# Developer Back End Test
The object of this test is to check your skills with different products that we use.
1.   Please clone this repository onto your local machine.
2.   Commit this to you own private github account without any modification on the master branch
3.   Create a branch development and push directly. This is where you work will begin.
4.   Install composer and necessary PHP7.2 / MySQL onto your local machine. We don't mind that you use Apache but Nginx is preferable.
5.   Install symfony onto your local workstation. Branch again to Symofny-Install Ignore vendors directory but add everything else and create a pull request to Devlopment Branch.
